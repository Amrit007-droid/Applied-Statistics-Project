# Applied-Statistics-Project
Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis using Descriptive Statistics
🔍 Problem Statement:

Welcome to the Probability and Statistics project! 📊🔍 In this exciting journey, you'll get the chance to apply the concepts you've learned in probability theory and statistics to analyze a real-world dataset. This project is your opportunity to dive deep into the world of data analysis and gain practical experience with the tools and techniques you've been learning. 🚀
🎯 Objective:

Your mission is to analyze the provided dataset containing customer information and purchasing behavior to make informed decisions. Your goal is to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that will help your company optimize its marketing efforts and increase offer acceptance rates. 🎉

Task 1 - Basic CleanUp
Clean and preprocess the dataset (handling missing values, data types, etc.).

Analyze the distribution of customer demographics (age, education, marital status) using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

Task 2 - Descriptive Statistics 📊
Calculate measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation) for key variables. Identify and handle outliers if necessary.

Task 3 - Probability Distributions 🎲
Identify variables that could follow specific probability distributions (e.g., Binomial, Normal). Calculate probabilities and expected values based on these distributions.

Task 4: Insights and Customer Segmentation 📈
Explore relationships between customer characteristics and spending habits. Segment customers based on their behaviors and characteristics.

Task 5: Conclusion and Recommendations
Create clear visualizations to showcase your findings. Use insights to make recommendations for the company based on your analysis.
